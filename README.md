# Getting Started with the Recipe App

A Recipe App frontend built for browsing, adding & removing recipes.

## Prerequisites

#### Make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
#### This front end requires [this backend api server](https://github.com/MinutHQ/home-assignment-recipe-be.git) to work properly. Set up the backend server according to the instructions there.

## Getting Started
Install the dependencies
### `npm install`

Start the Recipe app
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
